<p>Hex ontology is formal representation of human experiences of IEQ (Indoor environmental quality). IEQ is a concept refers to the quality of a building’s environment in relation to the health and wellbeing of those who occupy space within it. IEQ is determined by many factors, including visual comfort, indoor air quality (IAQ), thermal comfort, acoustic comfort. Occupants’ experiences often relate to these IEQ factors and provide the quality of them as well.  For example, the experience of occupant about thermal comfort is positive. Because all the IEQ factors have quality as characteristic, the relation has quality is established between IEQ factor and Quality
<p>But in the example mentioned before, we don’t know whether the positiveness of thermal comfort given by occupant A is caused by feeling warm or cold.  Because in many situations, occupants can feel positively warm or positively cold due to different age, culture, phicological factors. Hence, in order to capture thermal comfort, we need two charateristics which are quality and thermal sensation. In other words, thermal comfort can be categried as positively warm, positively cold, negativly warm, negatively cold and neutral. Similarly, for visual cofmort,  brightness and dimness are considered; loudness and quietness are taken into accout for describing acoustic comfort. 
However, there is no duality for indoor air sensation. Since normally people have positive feeling when the air is fresh; when the air is stuffy, often the feeling is negative. Hence in our ontology, we don’t have the duality of indoor air sensation.</p>
<p>Due to this fact, the characteristic of sensation is done on the sub-concepts of IEQ factor. For example, the relation of has thermal sensation is established between Thermal comfort and Thermal sensation, where Thermal comfort is the sub-concept of IEQ factor.
